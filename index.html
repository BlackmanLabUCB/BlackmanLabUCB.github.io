<h1>The genetic and ecological basis of plant adaptation</h1>
<p>Welcome!!  Our lab seeks to understand how development and its ability to respond to changing environmental conditions evolve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through a combination of molecular, genomic, and field studies, the lab aims to connect genes to phenotypes to ecology and in doing so address fundamental questions about the genetics of adaptation, the evolution of development, and mechanisms of gene-environment interaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our principal study systems are two unabashedly charismatic plants: sunflower and monkeyflower.</p>
